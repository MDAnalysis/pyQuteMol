Notes on compiling (Mac OS X 10.6.5 with MacPorts)

- get opengl stuff::
   sudo port install py26-opengl py26-opengl-accelerate glew
- compile GLEWpy from source http://glewpy.sourceforge.net/
  - needed to fix pyrex::
       cd /opt/local/bin && sudo ln -s pyrexc-2.6 pyrexc
  - 

ARGH. glewpy seems to be broken and not maintained anymore. see
https://trac.macports.org/ticket/18066

Means that pyQutemol needs to be rewritten with PyOpenGL.
